## Project Overview
The **Robotic Arm Prototype** aims to replicate human hand movements by tracking hand gestures through computer vision techniques. By detecting displacement between the palm and fingers, the robotic arm mirrors the user’s hand movements, allowing for natural control.

This prototype was showcased at the [Open House Exhibition](link-to-event-page) and received recognition for its innovative approach and potential applications in fields requiring gesture-based control.

## Key Features
- **Computer Vision-Controlled Movement**: Utilizes a camera to capture and interpret hand gestures, allowing for real-time control of the robotic arm’s movements.
- **Motion Mimicry**: The robotic arm replicates the movements of the human hand by translating detected gestures into corresponding actions on the model.
- **Flexible Articulation with Hinges**: The robotic arm is constructed with hinges at each joint, providing smooth, flexible movement and allowing multiple segments to articulate naturally.

## Hardware and Components
- **Microcontroller**: [e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi]
- **Motors**: Servo motors for joint articulation
- **Camera**: [Specify model, e.g., USB camera]
- **Hinges**: Installed at each joint to enable smooth movement and realistic motion
- **Power Supply**: A standard power bank is used to power the system.
- **Structural Components**: [e.g., aluminum, 3D-printed parts]

## Software Requirements
- **OpenCV**: For computer vision functionality
- **Python 3.x**: Primary language for control and image processing
- **Arduino IDE**: For microcontroller programming (if applicable)
- Required libraries:
  - `cv2` for image processing
  - `Servo.h` for motor control
  - `pySerial` for serial communication with microcontroller
